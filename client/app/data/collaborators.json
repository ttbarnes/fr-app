The aim is to be remembered, to implant an idea or emotion in the listener. you are singing a story, a hit record, a message to the lost or a soundtrack to a visual experience, don’t you want that piece of music to be remembered? for your intentions to be stand out in the most entertaining, dramatic and recognisable way?</p> <p>Writing, Recording and Engineering Credits Ed Sheeran, Katy, B, Sub Focus, Paul Van Dyke, Chase and Status, Wilkinson, Kasha Rae, Katy B, Ashleigh Ashley, Concrete Rose, Mic Righteous, English Frank, Aruba Red, Marvin Ambrosius, Speech Debelle, Iman, Sam Garrett, Mila Falls, The Stow, Baby Sol, Lianhart, Chrome, Jay Norton</p> <p>I've released original songs and compositions, remixed, edited, fixed and arranged pieces of music for the above artists and many more. If i was to describe my music style i would say it’s a Dark Romantic Adventure written by Scorsese with a Tarantino middle 8. With over 15 years of experience it feels like every stone has been turned but then stones have more than 2 sides.</p> <p>Send an email to <a href=\"mailto:jonhockley@gmail.com\">jonhockley@gmail.com</a> and help me become better</p>",
