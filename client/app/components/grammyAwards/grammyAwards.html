    <div class="about-fiona long-copy-line-height">
      <p>Independent British Jazz artist Fiona Ross has become known for creating her own contemporary jazz sound incorporating fast paced Latin Jazz, vintage Jazz club, a little neo soul along with heart wrenching ballads that demonstrate that <span class="highlight"><i>"Her style is poetic and the messages ooze with Millennial angst"</i> (Jazz weekly)</span>. She came to the world's attention as <span class="highlight"><i>"The artist that gave Ed Sheeran his 'first push'"</i> (Daily Express)</span>, but has very quickly established herself as an artist in her own right and has received incredible reviews across the globe. The album is an eclectic mix of songs that all sit under the heading of Jazz. From the big band feel of the title track, to the haunting, freer ballads, to some Latin and funk – something for everyone. Fiona has indeed created her own contemporary Jazz sound that appeals to a wider audience. Written, arranged and produced by Fiona, her new self released album has created a significant buzz proving that she is indeed Fierce.</p>
